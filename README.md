# horiseon-refactor-project
## Description
This project entailed reviewing the code for a website and making changes to better suit the user. One of these changes was adding semantic elements where originally there were none. Another change was condensing multiple seperate lines of code with similar properties, into a single cluster of code that retained all the same features. Additionally, I fixed a broken link and added a feature that underlined the  links when hovered over by a mouse.
